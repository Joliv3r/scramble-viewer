# Automatic Scramble Viewer

The purpose of this program is to automatically display the correct scrambles at a scramble PC using ssh to switch out the currently viewed pdf.

## Important notice
At the moment there is no security for unauthorized access to the program, so if you are using it in a official matter consider the program as holy as the scramble passwords.

## Dependencies
  * jq
  * wget
  * sed
  * qpdf

## Interactivity
When running the shell version you cannot use some normal shell shortcuts like arrow up and down. This is done on purpose becuase I am lazy.
